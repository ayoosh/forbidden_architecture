Github Rules
1. Keep any code in its respective assigned folder only. Inside the module specific folders Subteams can organise the way they want.
2. Only keep the main code files here. Create projects outside of this. Xilinx ISE, ModelSim and possibly perl/system c compilers may create lot of temporary files. Temp files pollute GitHub and makes code versioning so much more difficult.
3. Everyone is free to use the main branch for now. During integration we will change this.
